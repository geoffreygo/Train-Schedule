# Train-Schedule

This app allows you to see a list of train schedules and determines for you when the next train will arrive. You can add
new trains and they will immediately show up as a new row in the schedules. The page updates every minute unless someone
has started filling in the form.

This was an exercise in/introduction to firebase. The back-end data for trains that the user enters in is kept in firebase, with the arrival and minutes away being calculated on the fly in javascript.
